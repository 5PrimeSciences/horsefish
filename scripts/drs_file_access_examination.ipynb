Terra supports accessing data using the GA4GH standard Data Repository Service (DRS).

    "DRS creates a unique ID mapping that allows for flexible file retrieval. The unique mapping is the DRS Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) - a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular cloud-based resource (similar to URIs) and is agnostic to the cloud infrastructure where it physically exists. To learn where the file physically exists on the cloud, we must resolve the DRS through a backend service called Martha that will unmap the DRS URI to get the file's google bucket file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we check if all the DRS URIs can be resolved and check our access to the file it points to in the google bucket. If the DRS URI can't be resolved, we will record the error that will, later on, be shown in the report in the last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common reasons the DRS URIs can not resolve is \"Fence is not linked\". If you have this error, it is probably because the data is controlled-access. To use controlled-access data on Terra, you will need to link your Terra user ID to your authorization account (such as a dbGaP account). Linking to external servers will allow Terra to automatically determine if you can access controlled datasets hosted in Terra (ex. TCGA, TOPMed, etc.) based on your valid dbGaP applications.
