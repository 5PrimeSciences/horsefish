    "In this notebook, we get all the DRS URIs from the data table and check if we can access the file each DRS URI points to.\n",

    "This notebook will:\n",
    "1. Grab all DRS URIs from the data table\n",

    "\n",
    "The Data Repository Service (DRS) API is a standardized set of access methods that are agnostic to cloud infrastructure. Developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), DRS enable researchers to access data regardless of the underlying architecture of the repository (i.e. Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, etc.) in which it is stored. Terra supports accessing data using the GA4GH standard Data Repository Service (DRS).
