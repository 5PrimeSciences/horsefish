    "This notebook will:\n",
    "1. Grab all DRS urls from the data table\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Repository Service (DRS) API is a standardized set of access methods that are agnostic to cloud infrastructure. Developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), DRS enable researchers to access data regardless of the underlying architecture of the repository (i.e. Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, etc.) in which it is stored. Terra supports accessing data using the GA4GH standard Data Repository Service (DRS).

    "DRS creates a unique ID mapping that allows for flexible file retrieval. The unique mapping is the DRS Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) - a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular cloud-based resource (similar to URLs) and is agnostic to the cloud infrastructure where it physically exists. To learn where the file physically exists on the cloud, we must resolve the DRS through a backend service called Martha that will unmap the DRS url to get the file's google bucket file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we check if all the DRS urls can be resolved and check our access to the file it points to in the google bucket. If the DRS url can't be resolved, we will record the error that will, later on, be shown in the report in the last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most comment reasons the DRS urls can not resolve is \"Fence is not linked\". If you have this error, it probably because the data is controlled-access. To use controlled-access data on Terra, you will need to link your Terra user ID to your authorization account (such as a dbGaP account). Linking to external servers will allow Terra to automatically determine if you can access controlled datasets hosted in Terra (ex. TCGA, TOPMed, etc.) based on your valid dbGaP applications.
