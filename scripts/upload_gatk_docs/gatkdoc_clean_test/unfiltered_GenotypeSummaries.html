   Overview
  </h2>
  Summarize genotype statistics from all samples at the site level
  <p>
   This annotation collects several genotype-level statistics from all samples and summarizes them in the INFO field. The following statistics are collected:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Number of called chromosomes (should amount to ploidy * called samples)
   </li>
   <li>
    Number of no-called samples
   </li>
   <li>
    p-value from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test
   </li>
   <li>
    Mean of all GQ values
   </li>
   <li>
    Standard deviation of all GQ values
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Note
  </h3>
  <p>
   These summaries can all be recomputed from the genotypes on the fly but it is a lot faster to add them here as INFO field annotations.
